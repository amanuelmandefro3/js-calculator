# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear and backspace functionality.
- Responsive design.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply click the buttons on the calculator's interface. The input and result are displayed on the screen above the buttons.

- Click the numbers and operators to input an arithmetic expression.
- Click the equals button to evaluate the expression.
- Click the clear button to clear the input and result.
- Click the backspace button to remove the last character from the input.

## Implementation

The calculator is implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The arithmetic operations are implemented as separate functions. The `operate` function takes a string input, parses it into numbers and operators, and evaluates the expression using a stack-based algorithm.

The calculator's interface is implemented using HTML and CSS. The JavaScript code interacts with the interface by adding event listeners to the buttons and updating the input and result display.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced mathematical operations such as exponentiation, square root, and trigonometric functions.
- Add keyboard support for inputting expressions and controlling the calculator.
- Improve the design and user experience of the calculator's interface.
